# Image converter extensions
 
A collection of extension-methods to convert images between different library formats. As i am using SkiaSharp mostly, these extensions are mostly build around SkiaSharps SKImage class.

Currently supported:
 - SKImage <-> IMagickImage
 - SKImage -> EMGU.CV Image
 - SKImage -> BitmapSource
 - SKImage -> BitmapImage
 - System.Drawing.Icon -> SKImage
 - System.Drawing.Bitmap -> SKImage

More extensions are about to come.
